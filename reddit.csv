I even cracked a silly joke and the whole class laughed, it gave me a huge confidence boost.

I know it may be a small feat, but I felt so good about myself today.

I played in bands and was involved in my local music scene when I was in high school/college so I'm rediscovering a bunch of my friends' old bands, long forgotten demos I made with people, and just stuff you can't get anywhere else today and it feels great.

I used to take my iTunes library super seriously and prided myself on not having typos and making sure song titles were properly capitalized and all that cause music has always been the most important thing to me and I felt like a curator of sorts and wanted to take care of my music collection.

The age of iPods and iTunes came and went for me though and I've since moved on to other music platforms, but my iTunes library will always have a special place in my heart. To be able to see it and use it again is really something special to me. 

Does anyone here still use an old school iPod for music? I'm curious. 

Also, what's your guys' relationship with music like today compared to when you were young?

Edit: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I mean by songs that aren’t available online, i’m talking mainly about a) demos that I recorded with my friends which were never uploaded anywhere, and b) music I got off CDs of local bands that I got at local shows which were also never uploaded anywhere because it was before streaming music became popular.

Edit edit: For those interested I’ve put together a Spotify playlist with about 4 hours of new, old, local, lesser known or just nostalgic music from my Spotify library which you can find here: https://open.spotify.com/user/mtred13/playlist/7sw6hcIYEXWmKrW6M8f7u8?si=xRpbd1eNSkmbFXQPUiWfbg"

today, however, i was on the bus to work (the trip is about an hour long) and i fell asleep. i woke up like half way down the trip, i had my earbuds on playing one of my favourite playlists, there was a fine rain falling on the window but the sun was still shining in. i felt peaceful and just simply happy, enjoying the songs and watching the wind move the trees along the way, without worrying or overthinking as usual. i can't remember the last time i felt like this and i made sure to not ruin the moment stressing out like i usually do. i'm still not sure how i managed to, but i wish i could do this more often.

I said because she liked them.

We never said another word about it but got along just fine from that point forward. I even came to genuinely enjoy her company.

I gotta be honest, I melted a bit. Feels good to be complimented like that, especially from someone I admire.

I guess what I'm getting at is that you should make an effort to throw out that positivity to someone close to you. Might stick with them."

Thing is, I feel like I’m faking it too. I had a messed up childhood but it wasn’t actually that bad compared to many other people, so I’m also worried that I’m just a whiny man-child who can’t deal with adulthood.

Is it normal to have to spend $90 to go to a party? I have never been out clubbing for a birthday party before, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I have almost no value in myself, I feel it mainly comes from my families lack of time to actually get time to know me. I'm usually pretty sad, or even empty feeling due to feeling like nothing I do has actual impact on the world. A lot of people could probably catch onto how motivated I am by looking at my unkempt hair, the bent in heels of my shoes, and my overly pale complexion from not going outside. For a lot of my life, I've surrounded myself by people who value me as much as I do, sometimes I feel this has made me feel no one actually values me. That's frankly, 200% false.  Earlier tonight I wished my best friend a Happy Birthday, and while doing this I thought about good times I've shared with her. 

One that really stood out was one day when she said she was going to surprise me, and that I needed socks for when she picks me up. I don't know why, but I expected we was going to go trampoline or something, who knows. It turns out she had noticed the ware and tear on my shoes. I usually drag my feet, and a majority of the time I just slide on my shoes because I don't really think to put in the effort to fully put them on. She took me to a shoe store and got me a pair of shoes worth the price of almost every pair of shoes I've ever owned put together in my 20 years of life ($70 or so dollars, felt a bit guilty to pay attention to the tags), and I really had no idea how to thank her enough so I just kind of seemed unappreciative. I didn't know what to say. That night I went home and cried harder than I had in a long time. Every time I wore those shoes I went home and washed any dirt off. It was a level of kindness that meant so so much to me, and I'm still kind of watery eyed over it as I type this. Now why this may seem like an ode to her (and it partially is), the main thing this made me think of what I must mean to her. She was excited to surprise me, with something she knew I'd appreciate. How little could I really mean to the world if I had earned this care? Who am I to say I don't deserve someones kindness? Who are you to say you don't? 

How different would her birthday be today if I had done something really stupid a month or two ago? Even when it comes to people in our lives who are longer close to us, there is still so much to think abut. My ex and I ended on horrible terms, but there was a time she loved me enough to learn to say I love you in different languages despite being dyslexic and had enough trouble getting English correct sometimes. These examples both seem big, but things so small you might not notice them even matter a lot to. I value seeing friends like a dog values seeing their owner when they get home. I get anxious, I get ready hours in advanced, and I feel a bit of warmth in my chest. These are all things my friends never could tell whenever I get into their car, but it's a thing. I always feel I'm not important enough to get someone that excited, but what if I am? What chunks of people's hearts would I take with me if I left? How would my creative writing teacher who used my work as an example for what to do feel if all the words I could share with others never got shared because I wanted to be done with everything?

I use ""I"" a lot in this post, but that's because I can't speak for you, but I think looking at times people valued you more than you might do you some good! Let's talk about it, What's a time someone saw worth in you that you didn't see in yourself?"

That was years ago, and I kept with that drink consistently the whole time. Then I decided to start losing weight a year or so ago and looked into how many calories a 20-ounce latte can have — more than I wanted to budget for a warm drink most days. Plus, lattes are kind of expensive. 

So I switched to non-fat lattes for a half year or so, but I still knew that I was missing out on a whole world of potentially cheap/free coffee. So, after consulting a few handy coffee style charts on the Google, I found a low-calorie, cheap(er) option: the Americano.

I started with cream and sugar. Now I'm down to cream only. And, unlike all my past experiences with plain drip coffee, I actually enjoy these non-sweetened beverages. In fact, I had a vanilla latte the other day on a lark and found it way, way, way too sweet to bear.

Here in Australia o complete a certified training course one must have a unique student identifier code (USI). The code is easy and free to obtain via a government website and there are the standard security measures in place; password protection, back-up security questions, etc.

Two of the people getting the training are boomers. I spoke to them just 30 mins ago and asked them if they could find out what their USI is and cold they please get it to me so I could register them in the training course.

The first one simply opened a book she had on her desk that had all of her passwords listed in a nice organised manner, right there on the inside cover. At first she wrote down her password for me - it was just her dogs name followed by her year of birth - but then I said I need the actual USI, not the password to the USI. When she saw it was a bunch of random letter and numbers she insisted I just take a photo of the page. I asked if she was sure about that and she insisted yet again saying that ""with all those silly letters and numbers you might make a mistake if you write it down. A photo will be better.""

I took a close up photo of just the info I needed, but I very easily could've taken a photo of the entire page. She had her email passwords, facebook password, etc. It even had the answers to 2 security questions! Her best friend is her husband and her favourite pet is her dog Rita. I know where the book is - it's right there at her desk. She's bonkers!

Then just after that I called in another guy to do the same thing. He doesn't have a USI yet, so we sit down and make one for him. When it gets to the part about the password he just says ""Just put it as \[daughtersname1\], that what my password is for everything else.""

These two are absolutely crazy!"

I am being driven insane by a random, extremely foul smell in my apartment.",CasualConversation,4,dyxxso,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/dyxxso/help_i_am_being_driven_insane_by_a_random/,5,1574259260.0,"My wife and I have been living in a nice, affordable apartment for more than 2 years now, and give or take a couple of neighbor-related annoyance, everything would be perfect if it wasn't for 'the Stank'.'The Stank' started to manifest itself roughly six months into our moving there, and it's as if it has gained a special kind of evil sentience which has for only goal to make me feel and look mentally ill.

To begin with, 'the Stank' doesn't just smell bad, it smells vile. Try to picture a dead cat who ate the content of its litter box and threw up in bowl of rotten onions, and you'll get quite near what 'the Stank' smells like. Sometimes when it gets really intense, my nostrils get literally irritated.

Where it drives me completely insane is that this asshole of a smell comes and goes randomly and mostly during the early morning (2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.). Sometimes earlier in the evening. At first it manifests itself very discretely: it's there but just on the verge of detection. It can remain this way for days. Then it either disappear completely, or starts 'solidifying' in the very early morning, into what I described earlier. Once it's there, it comes back every night at various degrees of strength before completely vanishing, sometimes for weeks. Then, alas, it comes back. 

Now, of course we have cleaned the flat from floor to ceiling times and over again, sometimes with professional help. We've checked the pipes, our aircon unit, and every spot where a a small animal would hide and die, we experimented with blocking the kitchen sink's drain and overflow,  'The Stank' just keeps on coming back. 

Just in case, we've also called pest control. Long story short: the flat is squeaky clean.   
I have also investigated the corridor, gone in front of other apartment doors to try and smell whether it came from someone's unit. I did that on my floor, one floor above and one floor below, with no conclusive result -which would surprise me anyway since even cooking odors don't get inside. 

The second most confusing fact about 'The Stank' is that its point of origin seems to be dead in the center of our room, where there is nothing that could hide whatever matter/creature which somehow would work its stink job during the graveyard shift.   
I cannot afford to move out for many reasons, and right now 'The Stank' is costing me personally and professionally. Its random nature means that it's neigh impossible to call someone to witness it or help me track it down. To be honest, before my wife, whose sense of smell is barely functioning, smelled it too, I thought I was a victim of olfactory hallucinations. 

My sleep cycles are now a mess which taking a toll on my health and, on a more minor yet still noticeable level, my intellectual acumen.   
I'm posting this out of despair, maybe one of you dear redditors have experienced the same thing and found a solution? Thanks in advance and sorry for the wall of text."

Seems like just yesterday that we were ringing in 2010, and I was stoked for that as well. 2020 just has an extremely futuristic ring to it, and I remember growing up in the late 90s/early 2000s it was often a year for which ambitious futuristic projections were made. Either way, what are your hopes for the decade ahead?

A few of mine:

I hope space travel not only returns, but becomes fully mainstream. Hopefully this decade will be the one when private carriers like SpaceX and Boeing finally commercialize space travel, and make it at least somewhat more common and mundane than it is now while NASA focuses on getting the first humans to Mars.

On another space related note, I hope that the next generation of space telescopes will give us a better idea of what the universe is made of, how it will end, while exoplanet surveys will give us an idea of how many truly Earth-like planets there are and whether we are alone. Microbial extraterrestrial life may be discovered by the end of the decade as well, most likely on Mars.

We will probably have AI play a much greater role in our life, but I hope that rather than being defeated by the robot swarms, we manage to interact and integrate with it instead. For example, if there's a piece of information we need, we might be able to access the internet with our brain to get the needed facts.

Body enhancements. These are still a long way away but hopefully we get to see the first hints of new technology that may provide us with superhuman vision and hearing and a new way of perceiving the world.

Quantum computing will expand and may soon render the current silicon-based technology obsolete. While I don't see teleportation happening any time soon, I believe we might be able to conduct research at a much faster pace. Mathematicians will have a field day as problems that until now were extremely difficult to solve will be successfully tackled by the new quantum computers and hundreds of new and exotic theorems will be discovered.

Gene therapy and immunotherapy will revolutionize treatment for many diseases, especially cancer. No more will cancers be treated with a one-size-fits-all regimen of harmful chemo and radiation but every individual cancer will be carefully sequenced and a treatment plan handcrafted. Here's hoping that this helps increase dramatically survival rates for cancers usually considered incurable, such as lung, pancreatic, and brain cancers, and helps to quell our ever-present anxiety about one day being diagnosed with cancer that most of us suffer from subconsciously on a daily basis.

The one thing I'm most worried about is the decline of privacy. It's already been eroded to a large extent due to things like facial recognition technology and assistants like Alexa but I fear it may get even worse in the years to come. For example, in the interests of battling and reducing crime and protecting the environment, SmartCities might employ facial recognition cameras on virtually every urban street corner that can be used to track virtually any private citizen at any time.

Also, technologies like Google Glass may be resurrected and would further hugely undermine individual privacy. Also, the mass storage of online data being used to create blacklists. For example there is already a US-wide system in place at some bars and restaurants to identify and ban problem patrons, and the reasons for which the bans are handed out are often arbitrary. 

Employers often share blacklists of ""problem employees"" where the employees often have their reputations and careers ruined for seemingly inoccuous reasons, are unable to find out these reasons nor even that they are on such a blacklist in the first place, giving them little ability to prove these accusations wrong or have their names removed. Hopefully regulations will be implemented to better protect workers from such schemes.

Finally, mind-reading technology may be developed and popularized this decade and while it may have some advantages, such as allowing researchers to better understand the brain and helping paralyzed people communicate, there may also be nothing to prevent governments, corporations, or your jealous ex from gaining access to the contents of your thoughts which until now have been considered private and sacrosanct. 

All I can say is that while I am anxious about the decade ahead, I am also hopeful as well that as new technologies continue to proliferate our lives will become richer and we might live differently in ways we never thought possible in 10 years' time, and the benefits will ultimately outweigh any potential drawbacks and the world will be a better place to live than it is now."

88,A Caviar Dream,CasualConversation,3,dyuf65,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/dyuf65/a_caviar_dream/,3,1574241812.0,"I dreamt that I went to an evening party. A semi-formal, semi-casual affair, where no suits were necessary, and people were hanging around, drinking and talking like in a casual set-up, complete with drinks and snacks. The place is fairly decent sized, where we're all in a drawing, dining combined setting, and there's a fair few balconies and whatnot to slide out to, if some private moments are required. 

Then, suddenly, from the kitchen comes a couple of servers with plates of caviar. And straightaway my eyes are locked-in on that. I forget my company and the conversation, just locked-in on the caviar, like a heat-seeking missile. At this point, I feel obliged to tell you all that I've never had Caviar in my life. Always wanted to try it, simply because I've heard so much about it, but just never had the chance. It's one of those 'enamouring' things for me, always in the back of my mind as one of the lavish 'first' experiences I'm waiting for. 

I don't move towards it, or do anything overt, I show self control and wait for the server to come to me. Just as he's about to make his way over, he finds that there's no caviar remaining on his plate, and he turns back to the kitchen. I wait patiently. Again, the same story, but this time, as he's coming over, someone I know calls me over, and as I ponder on whether to head over and hope the caviar follows me there or be rude and wait for the caviar, that momentary distraction means I miss the server and he's off. 

Sadly, this goes on the entire evening, and my entire dream. At the final end, just as I'm standing with a server offering a full plate of caviar in front of me, my sisters wake me up. They say they heard noises coming from the house and got scared. I can't believe it. With inexplicable sadness, I head over to their room, and it's just windows and trees rustling in the wind outside. 

To end it all, I come back, try to get back in the dream, 're-enter' the party, but can't. The moments gone.

Anyone else have such vivid dreams they'd like to share?"

I remember one of the first times I was playing the original Doom at my friends house. Game was mindblowingly awesome but hard and really scary back then. I had a magazine with me with the cheat codes in it and we tried them out. 'IDDQD' gave god-mode or degreelesnes...or something, you couldn't die! Then 'IDKFA' all weapons and ammo, fantastic! But then we tried the next one 'IDSPISPOPD'.   
Must have written it wrong a couple of times, nothing is happening. One more try and then a red text appeared to the top: no clipping mode was activated.  
My friend started to walk through walls alerting enemies and walking through them. Both stared silently at the screen. Room after room, enemies roaring. He walked in circles around the large level then out of the game area. It was inexplicable sight at first. The rooms were all at the screen at once in vertical slices and they seemed to go on forever. Friend kept circling around in the weird doom hall of mirrors mess and we kept staring at the screen in silent awe. Then he closed the monitor. I was feeling odd and said I am going to go home.   
What happened was never discussed. My friend played and I played Doom since then and used the codes but I was very careful of not walking out the bounds. Something out there universe beyond the magic mirror was something completely horrifying.  Later I have learned how Doom works and it's not scary at all anymore, but that remains powerful memory of the first time I saw behind the curtain to the inner workings of a game."

98,I didn't take a job after graduation in March this year because I wanted to travel,CasualConversation,1,dyxzpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/dyxzpm/i_didnt_take_a_job_after_graduation_in_march_this/,3,1574259600.0,I wanted to travel abroad so bad and I never got to do it while in school so right after graduating I decided to do other stuff like a small online business and courses online hoping it would leave me free time to travel but guess what?

99,I tattooed someone for the first time!,CasualConversation,14,dym9d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/dym9d6/i_tattooed_someone_for_the_first_time/,17,1574207775.0,"Two weeks ago I quit an incredibly toxic job so I could put 100% of my energy into my tattoo apprenticeship. This past Saturday I tattooed one of my best friends and, although I was nervous and shaky and messed up a bit, it came out ok and she liked it! I’m so excited for the opportunity... I’ve wanted to become a tattoo artist since I was in middle school so this is a big deal for me. I was terrified to leave my last job knowing I won’t be making money for a while but I’m already so much happier."

I even cracked a silly joke and the whole class laughed, it gave me a huge confidence boost. At the end of my presentation, my professor pulled me aside and said this was a huge win for me and I did an awesome job. 

I know it may be a small feat, but I felt so good about myself today.

I mean...10 years ago I was living in another country with another wife. We had a whole life plan ahead of us, two families in common, a lot of people we loved, and, well, the whole thing.  
4 years later we got divorced and I returned to my country and never heard from her again. At least not first hand. I've sporadically looked at her IG and FB just to learn that she's been struggling with some things on her own, but not much else. She's still single and, obviously as social networks present to you an ""ideal"" life, it seems that her life has just gone good.  


A year later after I came back, I knew a girl and we started dating. 4 years later we are married and expecting our first baby. My family and her family get along very well and I have, again, a whole life plan with her.   


Also, along the way I got rid of some lifelong friends that I realized were bad for me. They were people that became toxic, both metaphorically and literally, as I smoked a lot with them. After I stopped seeing them, my life got SO MUCH better. Now I have a whole set of new friends, mostly because I tried to open my circles, started going to a nearby gym and now I have like 5 more people in my life that I consider true friends.  


I don't know, having all this happening in such an apparent short time sometimes is kind of overwhelming. Sometimes I think about my ex and those very big and personal plans we had, all the people that surrounded us, and seeing that vanished is kind of scary. But having now BIGGER plans, with y firstborn on it's way, with a new house, new job, and an almost new life is mind blowing."

I took the test back in 2017 when I had planned on going back to school and failed the section before the last section, but yesterday I passed that same section *and* the one after it! I had to take the placement test again because it had been more than two years since I took it previously. The last time I took it, I was planning on going back to school but a) couldn't afford it at the time and b) burned out on the idea and couldn't decide on a major. But now I'm enrolled as a full time student and have already paid for my tuition in full and have enough in my savings to pay for the three semesters after and won't need to take out student loans until I get to a four year school.

I gotta be honest, I melted a bit. Feels good to be complimented like that, especially from someone I admire.

7,Personal Social Media = Deleted.

I needed space from my suffocating family, and enough of my acquaintances had long since left the aging platforms like FB so it was an easy decision to finally leave.

&#x200B;

Strangely, my happiness did not improve, despite my increased investment in personal hobbies, activity, and health (I had a good chunk of time ""returned"" to me by removing social media, especially weekends). Instead, I feel even more isolated now, living in a ""small"" town where I cannot befriend any of the weird locals. My accomplishments or hobbies feel empty and lacking, I constantly feel upon experiencing something ""it would be great to share that with X"", or I write myself out of activities because Frisbee just isn't fun solo. I thought that removing my cringe one-sided long distance relationship (conducted via FB Messenger, how romantic) would free me from that particular emotional turmoil, but I just feel helpless now that all contact is broken. All the cute or funny things that I would normally share to that person still remind me of her, but now it just kills my excitement when I recall that that bridge is burned.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to manage in a world without any support group - my family is a bust, friends are hundreds of miles away, locals are unsuitable. I might have mental health issues, but I cannot take the leap to schedule an appointment for some reason. I refuse take on pets due to some personal problems. 

I just have been floating along in the current of the workplace ever since I got this job, just like I was just floating in the current of college before that. I cannot grasp the motivation to take my life in any specific direction - I am always driven by ""what does my company need"" or ""how can I help X"", never taking charge of my own life. I'm just feeling demotivated and out of place in this world, not an uncommon feeling for me. I suppose I expected that removing the constant negativity from Facebook et al would help, not worsen the problem.

Please, let me know if I'm not the only one."

I played in bands and was involved in my local music scene when I was in high school/college so I'm rediscovering a bunch of my friends' old bands, long forgotten demos I made with people, and just stuff you can't get anywhere else today and it feels great.

I used to take my iTunes library super seriously and prided myself on not having typos and making sure song titles were properly capitalized and all that cause music has always been the most important thing to me and I felt like a curator of sorts and wanted to take care of my music collection.

The age of iPods and iTunes came and went for me though and I've since moved on to other music platforms, but my iTunes library will always have a special place in my heart. To be able to see it and use it again is really something special to me. 

Does anyone here still use an old school iPod for music? I'm curious. 

Also, what's your guys' relationship with music like today compared to when you were young?

Edit: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I mean by songs that aren‚Äôt available online, i‚Äôm talking mainly about a) demos that I recorded with my friends which were never uploaded anywhere, and b) music I got off CDs of local bands that I got at local shows which were also never uploaded anywhere because it was before streaming music became popular.

Also, I'm on mobile and English is not my first language. 

Anyway, I know this is a well known issue, especially among girlgamers (even tho I wish I could consider myself as only a gamer) but I didn't think I could feel this uncomfortable even while playing with friends.

 I mostly play overwatch, but since I have no one to play with, I moved to fortnite very recently because a couple of friends of mine play it. 

I dont quite enjoy the game itself but I really liked just talking in voicechat and I thought I was doing  okay, considering it was my first time ever.

Now, today there were a couple of guys in team with who I'm not really friends with, but I felt confident and I didn't care about it too much.

What a mistake. As soon as I got into the game, they started treating me so bad that I felt dumb, they ignored me whenever I was saying something in vc so I stopped talking for the rest of the game and I  was forced to hear them claiming they were ""going easy"" on me because they pitied me.

I was so nervous I was literally shaking. I just Wanted to focus on my aim so I kept my distance and was using only a rifle. Again, I was doing fine, hitting headshots here and there, but for some reason my playstyle was so ""ridiculous"" that they
 kept talking trash about me whenever I sniped them.
Most of my male friends don't actually see me as a girl but I don't know why, even them just kept insulting me for dying whenever they pushed me, and of course, killed me.

I couldn't stand them for another round, so as soon as the game ended, I told them that I was leaving and that it was ""fun"" to play with them, but unsurprisingly no one answered, they just kept talking about whatever they were  saying.

I left, and no one really noticed. 

If I was considering playing more often with them, now I just wanna avoid even talking to them in real life. 

I have absolutely no problems with them being better than me, but I hated being left aside for what I have between my legs.

That if they wanted to pursue a career in the field and teach Bikram Yoga(which at that time was a sure shot hit method light years ahead of any other yoga method) they had to continue to allow his malicious advancements.

I have a student, her name is Alice, she's 14. She is quite promising, but very shy, despite my best efforts to ease that. We had been studying for several months until summer holidays, and I arranged with her mother to call me before the first quarter of the school year. She didn't do it (so I decided they found somebody else) until two weeks ago, and that's where I realised how fucked things were for the poor girl lately.

To start with, we have exams at the end of 9th and 11th class, she is in 9th now. Teachers became completely obsessed with exams, started artificially lower the marks because if the students get a mark in school better than on the exam, the teachers will be fined. 

Then, they started to literally flood the poor kids with homework, and that is combined with absolutely disastrous timetable with 7 lessons a day, and 6 days a week. 

Due to such pressure, some of Alice's classmates started losing their mind: one of her classmates stabbed another with a knife while another dude jumped off from 7th floor.

Terrified, Alice's mother decided that her daughter should leave this school ASAP and got her into another one. It wasn't any better. 

She got two F's in English right in the beginning because the English teacher couldn't manage to find some time and ask her homework at the lesson (in a class which is only 14 people, including Alice, might I add). Her mother asked him why he had done that, he exploded with uncontrollable rage but didn't state the reason. The head manager of the school did not want to help Alice's mother, either. So, they returned to the previous school.

I am not sure how things will go on, but I feel shocked and sorry for this poor girl. I don't even have the guts to imagine what's on her mind."

The other day, I was walking down a street. It was starting to rain, and me being a student and having a school bag, I carry my folded umbrella in there. As lazy and stubborn as I am, I mentally refused to take my bag off and I continued walking as I tried to fetch the zipper and the lower part of the bag to take the umbrella out. It must have been quite an amusing scene, because my arms couldn't reach behind me, so you had this person, just limply struggling to reach. I managed to take it out, but the problem was closing it again. Now, a little fact about me... I dislike interacting with strangers. Not that I am distrustful, but I have been taught all my life to avoid strangers, but in my honest opinion, I believe that not everyone is a horrible monster waiting for that one perfect moment to gobble up your limbs or rob you or something. I ''dislike'' it because people that have been raising me have been sceptical against them. So there I was, struggling with my zipper, when a seemfully cheerful person was walking in the opposite direction, approaching me slowly. I had this tiny fight in my head, whether I should stick to the rules I had been taught, or make a contact and simply ask them to help me. And you know what? I stopped the person, and openly and gently asked him if he could help me. He zipped up the bag, showed me a thumbs up and walked along. This really might not seem much to many people, but to me, it significantly brightened up my day, and cheered me up. I saw a proof to what I believed. That not everyone is terrible. That there are happy kind people around us, and blindness and overly huge distrust only makes me feel lonely, and unable to communicate properly. I really wish I could know more people. Friendships are cool, and play a big part in majority of people's lives. Soo... thank you for reading my little thought-article. Has some wholesome interaction with strangers happened to you too?"

The theory will never leave, but my hands don't work the way they used to. My left hand gets cramps, my right hand is just ever so slightly out of time, and the callouses are gone from my fingertips so it HURTS. Despite all of the above, I really had fun! Living a family life shouldn't mean missing out on hobbies that I love. Plus, I'm sure my little girls would love to sing songs with me.

Never tried to talk to her or even give her a sign, that she's totally a girl I wanted. Randomly i went through her IG account and I saw new photo of her and her boyfriend. I don't know why exactly, but I get kinda jealous about it. Not only because she have someone. But I know him. Not very well but we are in the same school and I was playing in volleyball school team with him. I will get rid of it probably. I just want to ask what you think about it.

I have almost no value in myself, I feel it mainly comes from my families lack of time to actually get time to know me. I'm usually pretty sad, or even empty feeling due to feeling like nothing I do has actual impact on the world. A lot of people could probably catch onto how motivated I am by looking at my unkempt hair, the bent in heels of my shoes, and my overly pale complexion from not going outside. For a lot of my life, I've surrounded myself by people who value me as much as I do, sometimes I feel this has made me feel no one actually values me. That's frankly, 200% false.  Earlier tonight I wished my best friend a Happy Birthday, and while doing this I thought about good times I've shared with her. 

One that really stood out was one day when she said she was going to surprise me, and that I needed socks for when she picks me up. I don't know why, but I expected we was going to go trampoline or something, who knows. It turns out she had noticed the ware and tear on my shoes. I usually drag my feet, and a majority of the time I just slide on my shoes because I don't really think to put in the effort to fully put them on. She took me to a shoe store and got me a pair of shoes worth the price of almost every pair of shoes I've ever owned put together in my 20 years of life ($70 or so dollars, felt a bit guilty to pay attention to the tags), and I really had no idea how to thank her enough so I just kind of seemed unappreciative. I didn't know what to say. That night I went home and cried harder than I had in a long time. Every time I wore those shoes I went home and washed any dirt off. It was a level of kindness that meant so so much to me, and I'm still kind of watery eyed over it as I type this. Now why this may seem like an ode to her (and it partially is), the main thing this made me think of what I must mean to her. She was excited to surprise me, with something she knew I'd appreciate. How little could I really mean to the world if I had earned this care? Who am I to say I don't deserve someones kindness? Who are you to say you don't? 

How different would her birthday be today if I had done something really stupid a month or two ago? Even when it comes to people in our lives who are longer close to us, there is still so much to think abut. My ex and I ended on horrible terms, but there was a time she loved me enough to learn to say I love you in different languages despite being dyslexic and had enough trouble getting English correct sometimes. These examples both seem big, but things so small you might not notice them even matter a lot to. I value seeing friends like a dog values seeing their owner when they get home. I get anxious, I get ready hours in advanced, and I feel a bit of warmth in my chest. These are all things my friends never could tell whenever I get into their car, but it's a thing. I always feel I'm not important enough to get someone that excited, but what if I am? What chunks of people's hearts would I take with me if I left? How would my creative writing teacher who used my work as an example for what to do feel if all the words I could share with others never got shared because I wanted to be done with everything?

I use ""I"" a lot in this post, but that's because I can't speak for you, but I think looking at times people valued you more than you might do you some good! Let's talk about it, What's a time someone saw worth in you that you didn't see in yourself?"

I started with cream and sugar. Now I'm down to cream only. And, unlike all my past experiences with plain drip coffee, I actually enjoy these non-sweetened beverages. In fact, I had a vanilla latte the other day on a lark and found it way, way, way too sweet to bear.

Here in Australia o complete a certified training course one must have a unique student identifier code (USI). The code is easy and free to obtain via a government website and there are the standard security measures in place; password protection, back-up security questions, etc.

Two of the people getting the training are boomers. I spoke to them just 30 mins ago and asked them if they could find out what their USI is and cold they please get it to me so I could register them in the training course.

The first one simply opened a book she had on her desk that had all of her passwords listed in a nice organised manner, right there on the inside cover. At first she wrote down her password for me - it was just her dogs name followed by her year of birth - but then I said I need the actual USI, not the password to the USI. When she saw it was a bunch of random letter and numbers she insisted I just take a photo of the page. I asked if she was sure about that and she insisted yet again saying that ""with all those silly letters and numbers you might make a mistake if you write it down. A photo will be better.""

I took a close up photo of just the info I needed, but I very easily could've taken a photo of the entire page. She had her email passwords, facebook password, etc. It even had the answers to 2 security questions! Her best friend is her husband and her favourite pet is her dog Rita. I know where the book is - it's right there at her desk. She's bonkers!

Then just after that I called in another guy to do the same thing. He doesn't have a USI yet, so we sit down and make one for him. When it gets to the part about the password he just says ""Just put it as \[daughtersname1\], that what my password is for everything else.""
